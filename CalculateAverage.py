Write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their average. Call the function with different values.

Solve:
def calculate_average(num1, num2):
    return (num1 + num2) / 2

print(calculate_average(9, 6))    
print(calculate_average(-9, 9))   
print(calculate_average(0, 0))   
print(calculate_average(8.5, 5.5))
